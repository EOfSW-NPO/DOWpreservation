# DOWpreservation

## Overview

DOWpreservation is a digital preservation initiative dedicated to recovering, restoring, and archiving images and videos related to the DOWs before they are lost over time. The repository focuses on collecting, organizing, and maintaining historical DOW media, including freely accessible datasets, to ensure long-term availability for research, education, and historical reference.

The project aims to safeguard valuable visual and multimedia records that may otherwise become inaccessible due to hardware degradation, link rot, platform shutdowns, or improper archival practices.

## Objectives

* Recover historical DOW images and video recordings from publicly available sources
* Restore and enhance damaged or degraded media when technically feasible
* Preserve original versions alongside restored versions for transparency
* Maintain structured metadata for traceability and research use
* Ensure long-term storage using standardized archival practices
* Provide organized access to freely distributable data

## Scope of Preservation

DOWpreservation may include:

* Photographic imagery
* Video recordings
* Derived datasets
* Metadata records
* Documentation related to archived material

All materials are categorized and stored using consistent naming such as "DOW1-2001" or "DOW3-1999" or maybe "DOW6-YUNKNOWN"

## Data Policy

This repository prioritizes:

* Public domain materials
* Freely licensed content
* Content with explicit permission for redistribution

Each archived item retains its original licensing information where applicable. The project does not claim ownership of third-party media unless explicitly stated. Metadata and repository structure may be licensed separately from the archived media itself.

## Current Legality and Institutional Context

This project is supported by the European Organization for Severe Weather (EOfSW, a NPO who operates freely), operated by XTECH, NPO. The EOfSW focuses primarily on French and German weather systems while also maintaining datasets related to American meteorological records.

At present, DOWpreservation is supported exclusively by XTECH, NPO. and the Polytech Sub-University of Cantanhede. The project does not currently receive funding or sponsorship from additional external organizations.

All preservation activities are conducted in accordance with applicable data redistribution and archival regulations.
